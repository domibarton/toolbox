Definition of all HACTAR core related forms.

Django provides a lot of tools and libraries to work with data inputs received
by the user. Forms are a big part of these libraries and they'll help you to
render, validate and save forms based on models. More about working with Django
forms can be found here:

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/forms/

Because we're using a Twitter Bootstrap theme we're not able to use Django's
stock forms and we're using a great alternative called Crispy Forms. With
Crispy Forms we can render forms in a Bootstrap-compliant way and even enhance
them to our desired look and feel. More about Crispy Forms here:
